## Overview

The Automatic Number Plate Detection project is an open-source computer vision project that focuses on detecting and extracting license plate information from images and video streams. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution for recognizing license plates in various real-world scenarios, such as surveillance cameras, traffic monitoring systems, and automated toll collection.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to locate license plates in images and video frames.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Extracts characters from detected plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.
- **Real-time Processing**: Designed to work in real-time or near-real-time scenarios, making it suitable for live video streams.
- **Customizable**: Offers flexibility to fine-tune detection models and OCR pipelines for specific use cases.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports recognition of license plates in multiple languages.
- **Easy Integration**: Provides APIs and sample code for straightforward integration into existing projects.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick setup and testing.
